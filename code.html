            <p>(((TODO: REVISE THIS ROUGH DRAFT))) My first foray into computer science was as a middle school student, enamored by the computer games I'd been playing since I was a young child. Using GameMaker's drag-and-drop interface to create code blocks, I learned the basics of conditionals, loops, and event-based programming.</p>
            <p>It wasn't until many years later when I was preparing for college that I seriously began to consider the prospect of pursuing computer science as a career. The final day of freshman orientation, I was given the opportunity to change my major one more time before it would become a much more difficult process further into a degree track; I decided on (somewhat of) a whim that I'd do it -- I switched my major from linguistics to computer science. Three years down the line, I couldn't be more satisfied with my choice.</p>

                Simple quiz application in which users complete questionnaires that determine whether they are more suited for one option or another (e.g. more suited to West coast versus East coast, more of a dog person or a cat person, whether they prefer beer or wine, etc). Users can save their progress, load previously-saved progress, change questionnaires, and answer the questions in any order they prefer.</p>

                For as long as I can remember I'd always wanted to get into web development as a potential career, but I never knew where to start. Thanks to Codecademy, however, I was finally able to learn not only the differences between markup languages, stylesheets, and front-end code, but more importantly how the three work together to create a smooth, functional interface for the end user.</p>
                <p>Besides jQuery, this site was created entirely by hand. No frameworks, no wrappers, no helpers. A lot of people have asked me why I didn't just save myself the trouble and use Bootstrap to make a pretty landing page in like, three seconds. While that certainly would have saved me a lot of time and effort, it was time and effort I wanted to spend; not only did it force me to learn good practices for website layouts/CSS, but also made me truly appreciate the effort that goes into tools that facilitate the kind of work I did by hand. For example, the media queries for the responsive design were an absolute <i>pain</i> to implement, but I'm glad I did them myself because now I have far more respect for frameworks that have responsive design included and accounted for by default.</p>
                <p>All that said, I will definitely start to learn various frameworks and helper tools as I continue my web dev journey. Creating my personal website has been an absolute blast; I had no idea I'd enjoy it as much as I do, and hopefully I can continue to hone my skills through future web projects.</p>

                <p><b>Tools:</b> GameMaker (GML)</p>

                <p><b>Description:</b><br/>
                <p>This is the bulk of the code I wrote for a coding/game development summer internship. The task I was given was to create a game from scratch in 3 days that simulated the 15-peg game featured on the tables of Cracker Barrel Restaurants (more info <a href="http://shop.crackerbarrel.com/toys-games/games/travel-games/peg-game/606154">here</a>).<p>
                <p>Official rules printed on Cracker Barrel game boards:</p>
                <p class="mus-quote">"Jump each tee and remove it - Leave only one? You're genius - Leave two and you're purty smart - Leave three and you're just plain dumb - Leave four or more, you're just plain eg-no-ra-moose."</p>
                <p>(...I don't know what that means, either.)</p>
                <div class="slideshow-code-2">

                    <img src="/img/E_Dock1.png"/>

                    <img src="/img/E_Seattle1.jpg"/> -->
                </div>
                    <p><i>(Images will be coming soon!)</i></p>
                <p>How I approached this task was to essentially create two arrays that pointed to each position on the game board. The first array points to the peg at the direct location (e.g. peg 1 was top, and enumeration would follow from left to right and down rows up to 15), while the second array is 2-dimensional -- the first dimension being the 'source' position, and the second dimension being the 'direction' I wanted to access. For example, secondArray[3]['UL'] would access the peg that is to the upper-left of peg 3 (which, in this case, is peg 1). This way I could reference, access, and modify both 'source' pegs and any of their direct neighbors.</p>
                <p>From here, most of the work became a series of conditionals to tell whether or not a move was viable -- meaning, there was a peg in the direct spot, but one spot further in the same direction was empty, and thus one could 'hop' the peg over its neighbor to said empty spot.</p>
                <p>Other general game mechanics I had to implement include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Selecting/deselecting a peg via mouse</li>
                    <li>Subtle camera movement dependent on mouse position to give game more life and a more dynamic aesthetic</li>
                    <li>Sidebar menu, including title, instructions, and various menu buttons:</li>
                        <li class="inner-bullet">Toggle sound/music</li>
                        <li class="inner-bullet">Toggle fullscreen</li>
                        <li class="inner-bullet">Reset gameboard</li>
                        <li class="inner-bullet">Exit game</li>
                </ul>
                    <p>Because I was limited to 3 days (more like 2, when you count the schoolwork I had to finish and the lectures I had to attend!), I was unable to do a lot of the things I would have liked. One thing I'd have liked to implement was various game board shapes and/or sizes. This would be extremely difficult if I were to use the current implementation, due to the fact that I essentially had to hardcode the two arrays. If I were to somehow be able to let the arrays dynamically create themselves by scanning their neighbors and putting them into the two arrays, that would be ideal. Oh well.</p>
