            <p>(((TODO: REVISE THIS ROUGH DRAFT))) My first foray into computer science was as a middle school student, enamored by the computer games I'd been playing since I was a young child. Using GameMaker's drag-and-drop interface to create code blocks, I learned the basics of conditionals, loops, and event-based programming.</p>
            <p>It wasn't until many years later when I was preparing for college that I seriously began to consider the prospect of pursuing computer science as a career. The final day of freshman orientation, I was given the opportunity to change my major one more time before it would become a much more difficult process further into a degree track; I decided on (somewhat of) a whim that I'd do it -- I switched my major from linguistics to computer science. Three years down the line, I couldn't be more satisfied with my choice.</p>

                <p>My coding experience so far has been mostly restricted to personal game development, school projects, and work projects. For the most part, I've tended to focus on programs that put the user experience first, whether through usability, appearance, functionality, or any/all of the above.</p>

                <p><b>Description:</b></p>
                <p>Simple quiz application in which users complete questionnaires that determine whether they are more suited for one option or another (e.g. more suited to West coast versus East coast, more of a dog person or a cat person, whether they prefer beer or wine, etc). Users can save their progress, load previously-saved progress, change questionnaires, and answer the questions in any order they prefer.</p>
                <p>I created this application to familiarize myself with Qt, a framework that specializes in GUI creation, allowing users to interact with a program through the use of windows, dialogs, input fields, and various other GUI elements provided by the OS.</p>
