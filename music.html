        <p>Growing up in a creative family, I was exposed to music at a very young age. I've been in a variety of musical ensembles of various shapes and sizes ever since then -- from concert band in middle school, to choirs in high school, to both at once for the first half of my undergraduate degree. Currently, I am music director and president of <a href="http://www.inthebuff.org" target="_blank">In The Buff</a>, the best men's a cappella group on CU-Boulder campus (it's true!).</p>
        <p>At 10 years old, I discovered the joys of music notation software (thanks, Finale Workbook!) and started composing my own work. At the age of 12, I discovered the joys of DAWs (thanks, Acoustica Mixcraft!) and continued to hone my skills. It wasn't until 2016 that I began composing music for <a href="http://serenityforge.com" target="_blank">Serenity Forge</a>, video game development and publishing studio based in Boulder. Since then I've been working on a variety of projects with them that have allowed me to grow immensely -- both as a musician and as an individual.</p>

                    <p>I started writing arrangements in 2014 upon joining my collegiate a cappella group, In The Buff. Ever since then, I've had the pleasure of arranging songs for the group to sing at private events, concerts, street performances, and even competitions.</p>
