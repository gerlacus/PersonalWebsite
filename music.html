        <p>Growing up in a creative family, I was exposed to music at a very young age. I've been in a variety of musical ensembles of various shapes and sizes ever since then -- from concert band in middle school, to choirs in high school, to both at once for the first half of my undergraduate degree. Currently, I am music director and president of <a href="http://www.inthebuff.org" target="_blank">In The Buff</a>, the best men's a cappella group on CU-Boulder campus (it's true!).</p>
        <p>At 10 years old, I discovered the joys of music notation software (thanks, Finale Workbook!) and started composing my own work. At the age of 12, I discovered the joys of DAWs (thanks, Acoustica Mixcraft!) and continued to hone my skills. It wasn't until 2016 that I began composing music for <a href="http://serenityforge.com" target="_blank">Serenity Forge</a>, video game development and publishing studio based in Boulder. Since then I've been working on a variety of projects with them that have allowed me to grow immensely -- both as a musician and as an individual.</p>

                    <p>I started writing arrangements in 2014 upon joining my collegiate a cappella group, In The Buff. Ever since then, I've had the pleasure of arranging songs for us to sing at private events, concerts, street performances, and even competitions.</p>

            <h2 class="first-h2">competitions</h2>
            <p>In The Buff has recently performed in a variety of a cappella competitions, most notably <a href="https://varsityvocals.com" target="_blank">ICCA</a> (International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella, better known as "that a cappella competition from Pitch Perfect"), where our group not only won 3rd place in our region's quarterfinal, but also received the <a href="https://varsityvocals.com/results-page/?fwp_year=2017&fwp_region=northwest&fwp_venue=utah-valley-university" target="_blank">"Outstanding Arrangement" award</a> for the three-song, 12-minute set I arranged (and they even mispelled my name on the website! But with a name like mine, I can't really blame them).</p>
            <h2>national television?</h2>
            <p>It was at the ICCA quarterfinal that we met fellow Colorado-based a cappella group, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/inthestairwell" target="_blank">In The Stairwell</a>. Hailing from the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, they put on a fantastic show and we had a great time getting to know them. Recently they've had success on NBC's America's Got Talent, where they wowed the judges with a performance of 'Drag Me Down.' It was at this time that I agreed to produce future arrangements for them, should they move on to rounds further into the competition. Fingers crossed!</p>

                    <p>I started composing for fun back in...approximately 2006? It wasn't until 2016 that some friends of mine working at video game development studio Serenity Forge gave me the wonderful opportunity to write the scores for two of their games: Mystic Melee and The King's Bird. I've had an absolute blast working with these guys, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for these games and for myself!</p>
