        <p>Growing up in a creative family, I was exposed to music at a very young age. I've been in a variety of musical ensembles of various shapes and sizes ever since then -- from concert band in middle school, to choirs in high school, to both at once for the first half of my undergraduate degree. Currently, I am music director and president of <a href="http://www.inthebuff.org" target="_blank">In The Buff</a>, the best men's a cappella group on CU-Boulder campus (it's true!).</p>
        <p>At 10 years old, I discovered the joys of music notation software (thanks, Finale Workbook!) and started composing my own work. At the age of 12, I discovered the joys of DAWs (thanks, Acoustica Mixcraft!) and continued to hone my skills. It wasn't until 2016 that I began composing music for <a href="http://serenityforge.com" target="_blank">Serenity Forge</a>, video game development and publishing studio based in Boulder. Since then I've been working on a variety of projects with them that have allowed me to grow immensely -- both as a musician and as an individual.</p>

                    <p>I started writing arrangements in 2014 upon joining my collegiate a cappella group, In The Buff. Ever since then, I've had the pleasure of arranging songs for us to sing at private events, concerts, street performances, and even competitions.</p>

            <h2>competitions</h2>
            <p>In The Buff has recently performed in a variety of a cappella competitions, most notably <a href="https://varsityvocals.com" target="_blank">ICCA</a> (International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella, better known as "that a cappella competition from Pitch Perfect"), where our group not only won 3rd place in our region's quarterfinal, but also received the <a href="https://varsityvocals.com/results-page/?fwp_year=2017&fwp_region=northwest&fwp_venue=utah-valley-university" target="_blank">"Outstanding Arrangement" award</a> for the three-song, 12-minute set I arranged (and they even mispelled my name on the website! But with a name like mine, I can't really blame them).</p>
            <h2>national television?</h2>
            <p>It was at the ICCA quarterfinal that we met fellow Colorado-based a cappella group, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/inthestairwell" target="_blank">In The Stairwell</a>. Hailing from the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, they put on a fantastic show and we had a great time getting to know them. Recently they've had success on NBC's America's Got Talent, where they wowed the judges with a performance of 'Drag Me Down.' It was at this time that I agreed to produce future arrangements for them, should they move on to rounds further into the competition. Fingers crossed!</p>

                    <p>I started composing for fun many years ago, but it wasn't until 2016 that some friends of mine working at development studio Serenity Forge gave me the wonderful opportunity to write the scores for two of their games: Mystic Melee and The King's Bird. I've had an absolute blast working with these guys, and I can't wait to see what the future holds!</p>

            <p><i>Mystic Melee</i> is a platformer that focuses on a combination of physics-based movement and elemental spellcasting combat. The story focuses on four arcane wizards whose fates become intertwined as they join forces to face an evil mastermind who threatens every corner of the cosmos. <i>Mystic Melee</i> was released to the public on August 2018 via Steam; check it out <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/454770/Mystic_Melee/">here</a>!</p>
            <p>The sample above is a promotional mix of various tracks from within the game. In order, these tracks are: Arboria, a forest planet with a hidden water temple (0:00 - 1:28); Summitar, a mountainous planet where the protagonists must climb to treacherous heights (1:29 - 2:42); the Waystation, a man-made satellite where the protagonists take the first steps towards adventure (2:43 - 3:54); and Mechanica (my personal favorite track!) where the evil mage Graven lives (3:55 - 6:30).</p> 
            <p>As my first paid project with an official game development studio, Mystic Melee holds a very special place in my heart. Combining orchestral and electronic styles was an absolute blast, and I cannot thank Serenity Forge for giving me the opportunity to work on such a neat project. I learned vast quantities of useful information through Mystic Melee, including how to properly revise tracks, how to create loopable tracks, and above all else how to transition from a hobbyist mindset to that of a paid, project-based musician.</p>

            <p><i>The King's Bird</i> is a momentum-driven, story-heavy game that combines parkour with aerial movement. The official <i>King's Bird</i> website does a better job of describing it than I ever could: "escape into a world kept secret by a tyrant and discover the truth about your freedom. A momentum-driven game that seamlessly combines parkour with aerial movement. Dash, glide, and flow through the world with precision and grace." <i>The King's Bird</i> will be released in Q2 2018 for PC and major consoles.</p>
            <p>This sample, like that for Mystic Melee above, is a mixture of a number of tracks within the game. They are, in order: The cinematic opener, which introduces players to the main musical motifs within the game (0:00 - 0:45); the looping menu music, sharing the same theme as the cinematic opener (0:46 - 1:46); the Forest Kingdom, in which the protagonist blissfully experiences true freedom for the first time (1:47 - 3:27); and the Flying Kingdom, at which point she begins to realize that something is terribly wrong (3:28 - 5:33).</p>
            <p>The musical direction -- and the general creative goal as a whole -- was geared towards building a world that was reminiscent of a number of Earth's cultures without being directly correlatable to any one of them. This 'culturally ambiguous' approach to the art lead to a very unique style of architecture, environment, and general tone to the game as a whole. In order to best fit the music to such a world, I researched a number of different cultures' music. Drawing from Native American, South-East Asian, Celtic, and even Sub-Saharan African influences, I began to create a style of music in which flute lines fluttered, ethnic percussion pounded, and choirs, pianos, celestes, and string orchestras filled in the rest of the sound. The result is a fantastical, shimmering, and even wistful soundtrack which I hope is worthy to accompany the protagonist on her journey through a magical and mysterious world.</p>
